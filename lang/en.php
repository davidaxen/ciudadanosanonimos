The need to access said resources must be appropriately informed in the application's privacy policy, so that the user can decide whether or not to grant authorization to the application to access said resources. Second, guidelines are also developed for data controllers who commission the development, production and / or exploitation of applications to third parties, with access to personal data, they must ensure that they comply with the requirements established in the RGPD for each of the parts.
