The need to access said resources must be appropriately informed in the application's privacy policy, so that the user can decide whether or not to grant authorization to the application to access said resources. Second, guidelines are also developed for data controllers who commission the development, production and / or exploitation of applications to third parties, with access to personal data, they must ensure that they comply with the requirements established in the RGPD for each of the parts. These guidelines complement the “GDPR Guide for data controllers” and “Guidelines for drawing up contracts between data controllers and data controllers”. The data controller must ensure that they comply with all the active liability requirements contained in the RGPD, also ensuring that the data controller only processes the data in accordance with his instructions and taking measures to ensure that this is the case.
